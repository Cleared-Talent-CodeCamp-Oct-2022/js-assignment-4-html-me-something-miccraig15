         <h1 id="mainHeading">Three years on Oahu, Hawaii</h1>
            <p id="testP" class="funparagraph">During my time in the military, I was stationed on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
                Immediately, there was a huge case of "culture shock" from what I was used to back in Texas.  Over the course of time, I fell in love with the island
                and am grateful for the time I spent there.  I gained a love for new places and new things and love sharing my experiences.

               <h2>FOOD</h2>
               <p>The island is full of new experiences when it comes to food. Just when you think you have tried everything, you find something else that is delicious. A few of my favorites are kalua
                  pork, shaved ice, and sushi.  Oahu has a handful of big "chain" restaurants, but my favorites were always the small, local places found scattered across the island.</p>

               <h2>HIKING</h2>
               <p>The island of Oahu is beautiful and absolutely stunning.  There is no better way to take in it's natural beauty than on a hike.  Oahu has a hike for everyone, from the easy strolls near the
                  coastline to challenging hikes up the side of a crater or mountain.  No matter where you hike, you will inevitebly see something that makes you stop in your tracks, and take in the
                  magnificent beauty of the island.</p>

               <h2>SNORKELING</h2>
               <p>Naturally, being an island, there are many activities to enjoy that take place in or on the water.  One of my favorite ways to take in the water and the wildlife living within is snorkeling.
                  There are countless spots along the beaches that are a prime enviornment for snorkeling.  Snorkeling is also a relatively inexpensive option, as all you need is a snorkeling mask to do it.
                  The first time I saw hundreds of fish swimming beneath me, as I quietly swam by, I was hooked.  The most common creatures seen are fish, starfish, and sea urchins.  Occasionally, you
                  can spot a sea turtle!</p>

               <h2>SURFING</h2>
               <p>Whenever people think of Hawaii, they always think of surfing.  I only managed to get out surfing a few times when I was in Hawaii, and let me tell you, it is not easy.  It takes a lot
                  of strength and endurance to get you and your board out to the break.  But once you are out there, it is amazing.  I will never forget the first (and only!) time I caught a wave and
                  road it all the way back to the shore.  I regret not getting out to surf more before I left the island.

               <h2>FAVORITE PLACES</h2>
               <p>Oahu is a highly traveled tourist destination, but outside of the downtown area, there are many wonderful places to visit.  As often as I could I would spend time traveling to all parts
                  of the island to explore and see new things.  I found myself frequently going to some of the same places over and over again, and they quickly became my favorite places on the island.
                  Some of those places are Pearl Harbor, Polynesian Cultural Center, Kane'ohe Bay, and the North Shore.

                     <h3>Pearl Harbor</h3>
                     <p>Pearl Harbor is historically known as being the location of the Japanese Attack on American Soil on June 6th, 1945.  It still serves as an active Navy base.  Within Pearl Harbor are
                        several memorials to those who fell victim to the attack.  Most notably is the USS Arizona Memorial.  You can also take a tour on the USS Battleship Missouri, which is where the
                        "Instruments of Surrender" were signed on September 2, 1945 that brought about the end of World War II.

                     <h3>Polynesian Cultural Center</h3>
                     <p>The Polynesian Cultural Center has an entire campus dedicated to the education of Polynesian cultural life.  "Performers" from different Polynesian islands entertain and educate guests
                        with authentic history and cultural activites.  The performers are native to the islands they represent.  The islands represented are Aotearoa (New Zealand), Fiji, Hawaii, Samoa,
                        Tahiti, Tonga, and Rapa Nui.  Visiting here was always an amazing experience and deepened my understanding and appreciation of polynesian culture.

                     <h3>Kane'ohe Bay</h3>
                     <p>On weekends, quite often I would ride my motorcycle out to Kane'ohe Bay.  The quickest way to get there is to take the H3 highway, which is built through a mountain.  The tunnel
                        inside the mountain is a mile long, and once you emerge on the other side, you are greeted with one of the most beautiful views on Oahu.  The tunnel is several hundred feet above the
                        bay and slowly winds down.  It is nearly impossible to keep your eyes on the road!

                     <h3>North Shore</h3>
                     <p>Another weekend destination, the North Shore of Oahu is home to approximately 7 miles of shoreline, most of it beaches.  North Shore also hosts the worlds best surfers between
                        November and December each year as the swells of the coast are pristine for professional surfing.  No matter where you are on the North Shore, it is easy to find a spot on the
                        beach to camp out, relax, and enjoy the water.

                     <h3>Byodo-In Temple</h3>
                     <p>Located at the base of the Ko'olau Mountains in the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park is the Byodo-In Temple.  It is a smaller replica of the nearly 1000 year old temple in
                        Uji, Japan.  In my opinion, this is the most peaceful place on the island and I would often walk the grounds whenever life got a little too stressful.  The temple was built
                        in 1968 to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the first Japanese immigrants to Hawaii.
